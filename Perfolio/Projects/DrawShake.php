		<h2> Draw Shake </h2>
		<p><b>
			This was my first Android app that I made with a team. This App is a fun drawing app where you can draw art with your finger
            or use nobs to control a line that draw to the screen. to erase the drawing you need to shake the screen. During the creation of the app 
            I was tasked for making the menu UI as well as the nobs and there animation used to draw to the screen.
