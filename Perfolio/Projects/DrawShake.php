		<h2> Draw Shake </h2>
		<p><b>
			This was the first Android app that I made with a team. This App is a fun drawing app where you can draw art with your finger
            or use nobs to control a line that draws to the screen. This project was semester long and I learned a lot about project management  
            the importance of using a project lifecycle model and how it is a key aspect of any project.
