			To help improve my skills in developing games I decided 
			to take a Unity course in Computer programming. 
			In doing this course not only did I learn more about
			how to use and program games in unity but I also learned 
			that within the IT industry things are always changing 
			and theres always a new or better way to do something. With this in mind, 
			even of I cant learn everything, I want to try me best to learn and try new 
			things so I can apply them to my work and improve my skills. 
			<br/><br/>
			Here are some of my favorite games I made during the corse and what I learned:

		<p><b>
			In this game I made a Platform game where you need to jump over obstacles 
			without being hit. I also learned how to add sounds and particle effects to a game 
			and use state machines to trigger deferent animations.

	<h2> Defense </h2>
		<p><b>
			In this game you need to rotate the camera to change the direction of the player, 
			as well as pickup power ups to nock enemy's of of the platform to then spawn for enemy's.
			I leaned how to make waves of enemy's spawn depending on specific events and and how to make more
			interactive games by making the game harder as the player plays.
