		<h2> Not Pong </h2>
		<p><b>
			This is my group's game that we made for the Bad Mama Jama Game jam. We had only 42 hours to make a working game. 
            In this game, you play as the ball in a futuristic game of pong. In doing this project I was able to experience how it feels to work in fast fast-paced team environment.
