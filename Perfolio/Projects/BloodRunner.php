		<p><b>
			My very first indie game. I am slowly developing as a side project in my free time. However, after a while,
		 	I decided to focus on other projects to improve my skills and wanted my first full-fledged game to be special. 
		 	I see this as my first step in becoming a successful developer is doing smaller projects and improving my skills 
		 	can help lead to better products.
