		<h2> Blood Runner </h2>
		<p><b>
			My very first indie game. I am slowly developing as a side project in my free time. In this futuristic world amidst a war against an unknown alien race, 
			the GHDS (Galactic Humanity Defence Systems) has created a new combat unit LHMBD (Last Hope Mission Before Destruction). 
			The LHMBD consists of the Earths finest solders, Specializing in stealth, hand to hand combat and solo missions. 
			When critical intel or locations are compromised by the enemy, it is the LHMBDs job to recover or destroy what was lost by any means necessary. 
			You play as a member of LHMBD code named Blood Runner, assigned to take back one of GHDSs high-tech space stations, 
			that has been overrun by an unknown threat. Remember if you fail, the technology with the ability to save humanity will be destroyed. 
			Blood Runner is still in production link will be here once available.
