		<h2> Career Goals and Experience </h2>
		<p><b>
			I plan on building a courier in game development and digital design. Making video games is a hobby of mine,and I have recently started to develop my first Indie game titled Blood Runner. However, after a while, I decided to focus on other projects to improve my skills and wanted my first full-fledged game to be special. 
		 	I see this as my first step in becoming a successful developer is doing smaller projects and improving my skills 
		 	can help lead to better products.
		<br/><br/>
			Not only do I enjoy making games but I also like to make other types of software and websites. 
			I have experience working for companies making the front and backend softwear to add view and store data. 
		<br/><br/>
			I enjoy the teamwork and unique solutions and ideas that come from doing large software and game development projects, 
			and I believe that team work can lead to product success.
